# Programming Foundations - Todo App TDD Series 

Internal unit testing for V1 - V12 of the todo app that's built over the course of Programming Foundations. Done by version mainly for test driven development practice, to prepare myself to write the grading unit tests for the Watch and Code student code exercise submissions. 

Unit tests live in the HTML files to cut down on the number of files committed to this repo.

Uses the tiny testing framework, simpletest.js.
